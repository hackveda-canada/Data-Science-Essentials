However, Juniper\\nResearch and Intel believe that these studies do not sufficiently account\\nfor the most important part of the city itself: its citizens.\\nAs such, Juniper has conducted a study of smart cities across the globe\\nwith the aim of uncovering the measurable time rewards to citizens:\\nTime: how can smart cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 technology and strategies be used to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98give back\\xe2\\x80\\x99 time to citizens? Free time is a scarce commodity in the\\nmodern world and has a powerful impact on an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to\\nreduce stress, maintain happiness and health.\\nJuniper examined cities in terms of their progress, and future\\npotential, across 4 key indices, with the goal of evaluating how\\n\\nthey might deliver positive citizen outcomes in terms of time and\\nquality of life. These indices are:\\nMobility: urban transport systems, including public and private\\ntransport. Also includes non-motorised transport solutions.\\nHealthcare: healthcare service delivery for citizens, including\\naccess to services and performance.\\nPublic safety: city safety as measured by crime levels, mortality\\nand law enforcement services\\xe2\\x80\\x99 efforts to combat these\\nchallenges.\\nProductivity: city policies and technologies in use aimed at\\npromoting citizen productivity, democratisation of services and\\nwealth distribution.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nSmart Cities Will Deliver\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\n3\\n\\nSmart Cities will Deliver 15 Working Days\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf cities across the globe today were to universally adopt, and deploy, smart city technology and services, what would the benefits be for citizens?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTime Given Back\\nSmart cities have the potential to \\xe2\\x80\\x98give back\\xe2\\x80\\x99 each city dweller 3 working weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of time every year.\\n\\nHow will This Time be Created?\\n\\nBenefits to Smart City Inhabitants\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nWhy do We Need Smart Cities?\\nThe Emergence of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 & Overcrowding\\nThe 20th and 21st century haven given birth to some 37\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (cities with populations greater than 10 million individuals),\\nincluding Tokyo, Mexico City, New York City and Rio de Janeiro.\\nIn each of these cities, the density of the population in relation to available\\nresources, infrastructure and services has given rise to complaints about\\novercrowding, while demand for affordable housing, proper sanitation,\\nfood supply and healthcare services are all put under pressure as a result\\nof mass migration to large cities.\\n\\nCities are thus being forced to consider how to alleviate these\\npressures; technology, analytics and modern urban policies are\\nemerging as \\xe2\\x80\\x98smart solutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to deliver sustainable, efficient\\nenvironments for citizens.\\n\\nQuality of Life\\nOne of the main drivers for urban migration has been the\\npromise of a higher quality of life, driven by increased personal wealth and\\na greater number of life-opportunities. As a result, cities are under\\npressure to present themselves as more favourable places to live and\\nwork, competing to attract the best talent and investment.\\n\\n4\\n\\nMeanwhile, many cities suffer from a large inequality gap; the favelas of\\nRio de Janeiro provide a notable example of vast differences in quality of\\nlife across cities.\\n\\nSmart cities are those that recognise these challenges and adopt their\\nplanning and strategy to address them. This requires smart policies to\\nensure wealth is not distributed unevenly, alongside technology as an\\nenabler.\\n\\nCongestion & Air Pollution\\nThe motor vehicle, often presented as a symbol of personal\\nfreedom, is commonly anything but, inside city limits. High\\nvolumes of vehicle ownership, coupled with 20th century urban planning\\nmodelled around the automobile, have created massive pressure on the\\nroad infrastructure. Consequently, long traffic jams are a frequent\\nbug-bear for citizens, elevating stress levels. Additionally, the slow\\nmovement of traffic increases the volume of microscopic particulate matter\\naffecting the health of drivers, as well as those on the streets. Traffic, and\\nair pollution, are serious issues facing cities today.\\nAddressing urban mobility is one of the key aims of smart cities, not least\\nbecause of the substantial benefits realised in reducing congestion.\\nIntelligent traffic systems are key here, alongside smart investment and a\\npolicy to reduce motor vehicle use.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nHow do These Factors Affect Me Today?\\nIt is difficult to understand the need for smart cities when presented with\\nabstracts that cannot easily be associated with the global population. As\\nsuch, we have contextualised today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s need for smart cities into a number\\nof problem statements.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeavy Congestion in Cities can Result In Drivers\\nSpending More than 70 hours per Year in\\nGridlock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n5\\n\\nEven an annual figure as \\xe2\\x80\\x98low\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as 2% means that most individuals are\\nlikely to suffer violent crime at some point during their lives.\\nViolent crime resulting in personal injury can often mean time lost in\\nhospital or rehabilitative care. Additionally, there are psychological\\nconsequences to consider; anxiety and stress can be damaging to an\\nindividual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-being. Indeed, a 2015 study by the Office for National\\nStatistics found that 20% more non-victims of violent crime reported\\nfeeling that their life was worthwhile in comparison to those that had\\nbeen victims.\\n\\nIn many cities, the average peak-time vehicle speed is a crawling 4mph\\n(6kmh);\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHospital Overcrowding in Cities can Result in\\nPatients Waiting Longer Than 4 Hours for a Bed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe stress of the morning commute has been shown to be hazardous to\\ncitizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 health; a study by the British Cardiac Patients Association in\\n2004 found that emergency call-outs for life-threatening heart attacks\\nand strokes peak between 8am and 11am;\\n\\nMany cities across the globe report very high hospital bed occupancy\\nrates (over 85%). This can result in exorbitant wait times for in-patients,\\nresulting in time wasted and additional stress for both patients and\\ncaregivers. In a healthcare scenario, this exacerbates the likelihood of\\nmistakes being made.\\n\\nWHO estimates that 3 million deaths every year are attributable to small\\nparticulate matter pollution, a large portion of which is generated by\\nvehicle emissions. High levels of congestions result in higher levels of\\nharmful pollutants in the air.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCities Suffering from High Rates of Violent\\nCrime are Statistically Likely to Impact the\\nMajority of the Population\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAs a result of high levels of inequality, a large population mass and\\nopportunity for organised crime operation, cities are often relatively\\ndangerous places to live.\\n\\nFurthermore, studies have indicated that overcrowding in hospitals can\\nincrease the risk of patients contracting an infection during their stay; in\\nsome cases this risk is increased by over 10%. This means that patients\\nin hospital for non-life-threatening conditions may be exposed to\\nenvironments that could prove fatal for them.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\n6\\n\\nGlobal smart cities: who are the leading performers today?\\nThe study has ranked the top 20 global smart cities according to their performance and project deployments\\nacross the 4 indices studied, alongside their published strategies and key goals for future city development.\\nThe Top 20 Global City Performance by Index, 2017\\nMobility\\n\\nHealth\\n\\nSafety\\n\\nProductivity\\n\\n1\\n\\nSingapore\\n\\nSingapore\\n\\nSingapore\\n\\nSingapore\\n\\n2\\n\\nSan Francisco\\n\\nSeoul\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nLondon\\n\\n3\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nChicago\\n\\nChicago\\n\\n4\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nSeoul\\n\\nSan Francisco\\n\\n5\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nDubai\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\n6\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nNew York\\n\\n7\\n\\nChicago\\n\\nSan Francisco\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\n8\\n\\nPortland\\n\\nMelbourne\\n\\nSan Francisco\\n\\nMelbourne\\n\\n9\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nRio de Janeiro\\n\\nSeoul\\n\\n10\\n\\nMelbourne\\n\\nChicago\\n\\nNice\\n\\nDubai\\n\\n11\\n\\nSan Diego\\n\\nPortland\\n\\nSan Diego\\n\\nSan Diego\\n\\n12\\n\\nSeoul\\n\\nDubai\\n\\nMelbourne\\n\\nNice\\n\\n13\\n\\nNice\\n\\nNice\\n\\nBhubaneswar\\n\\nPortland\\n\\n14\\n\\nDubai\\n\\nSan Diego\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\n15\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nWuxi\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nWuxi\\n\\n16\\n\\nWuxi\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nPortland\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\n17\\n\\nRio de Janeiro\\n\\nYinchuan\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nRio de Janeiro\\n\\n18\\n\\nYinchuan\\n\\nHangzhou\\n\\nWuxi\\n\\nYinchuan\\n\\n19\\n\\nHangzhou\\n\\nRio de Janeiro\\n\\nYinchuan\\n\\nHangzhou\\n\\n20\\n\\nBhubaneswar\\n\\nBhubaneswar\\n\\nHangzhou\\n\\nBhubaneswar\\n\\nSource: Juniper Research\\n\\nAnalysis of cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 performance in each index revealed some notable\\nresults.\\nMobility winners:\\nSingapore, San Francisco and London were found to be\\nworld-leading cities in addressing urban transportation\\nchallenges. Singapore, for example, has applied smart, connected traffic\\nsolutions, in conjunction with very strong policy curtailing car ownership in\\nan effort to reduce the number of vehicles on its roads. This level of policy\\nenforcement is not possible in San Francisco or London; consequently,\\nthese cities have applied their own traffic calming technology solutions\\nalongside long-term visions for transformative transportation paradigms in\\nthe form of MaaS (Mobility as a Service) and AVs (Autonomous Vehicles).\\nMobility Trailers:\\nTrailing cities in this index include Yinchuan, Hangzhou and\\nBhubaneswar. The study found that, in spite of notable\\nroll-outs such as Yinchuan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98pay-by-face\\xe2\\x80\\x99 public bus service, overall\\nefforts to reduce congestion levels are at an early stage relative to the\\nleading cities. For instance, public transport availability and uptake as a\\nwhole was found to be low, while key future urban transport innovations,\\nsuch as shared transport solutions and AVs, were not found to form part of\\nthe cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 long term vision.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nHealthcare winners:\\nThe leading cities in this index were found to be Singapore,\\nSeoul and London. Both Singapore and Seoul were notable\\nin terms of their focus on addressing healthcare service provision for\\nelderly citizens through a range of technologies, including digital service\\nplatforms as well as remote monitoring devices. If one considers the fact\\nthat, on average, the number of annual visits to a physician increases\\nsubstantially as one ages, it is clear that these strategies form a crucial\\npart of ensuring that the overall healthcare system is not overburdened; in\\nturn, improving overall healthcare outcomes. Meanwhile, London has\\napplied a broad strategy that combines innovation (such as bicycle share\\nschemes), telehealth and a strategy to reduce healthcare inequality in the\\ncity.\\nHealthcare Trailers:\\nHangzhou, Rio de Janeiro and Bhubaneswar were found to\\nhave continued challenges that could be addressed through\\ntechnology and smarter policy. Rio and Bhubaneswar continue to have\\nrelatively low levels of hospital bed availability, which could be addressed\\nthrough better preventative healthcare measures; first by improving\\ncitizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 level of access to digital services as well as wider roll-outs of\\ntelehealth and local connected clinics. Meanwhile, all 3 cities suffer from\\nvery poor air quality levels, with proven negative impacts on citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nhealth.\\n\\n7\\n\\nSafety Winners:\\nSingapore, New York and Chicago ranked highly in this\\nindex. In the case of New York, the city has worked hard over the last 25\\nyears to address what was an epidemic of violent crime. This was\\nkickstarted by a data-driven approach and has since developed into one\\nwhere predictive modelling is a key asset both for law enforcement as well\\nas the fire department; a strategy replicated by Chicago. Singapore\\nmeanwhile, has trialled smart video surveillance to detect criminal activity.\\nSafety Trailers:\\nWuxi, Yinchuan and Hangzhou were noted to have deployed\\nsmart initiatives (smart video surveillance forms part of\\nYinchuan and Hangzhou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public safety initiative for example), but have\\nnot yet reached a level of integration between emergency services to\\nachieve the optimum response; an important factor in reducing response\\ntimes and positive outcomes. Meanwhile, these cities have either not\\nclearly outlined, or have a limited strategy to deal with major safety issues\\nsuch as road traffic incidents and threats posed by cybercrime. This latter\\npoint is particularly pertinent to Chinese cities, owing to the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high\\nlevel of smart grid investment and consequent connection of critical\\ninfrastructure to the Internet.\\nProductivity Winners:\\nThe ability to not only encourage digital innovation to\\naddress city challenges, but also the ability for citizens to\\naccess digital services and city information was judged by Juniper to be\\ncritical in improving citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 productivity.

Its transformation, over\\nthe remarkably short time after its split from Malaysia, to the world's\\nleading smart city, provides an example from which other cities can learn.\\nThe positioning of the 5 US cities provides an interesting contrast. Overall,\\nNew York, San Francisco and Chicago were found to have a broader,\\nmore in-depth smart city vision and are further along in terms of execution.\\nIt is likely that pressures created by their standing as population-dense\\nmetro areas, alongside inherent talent in IT services, has spurred their\\nsmart city journey earlier. Meanwhile, cities such as San Diego and\\nPortland can be considered as close to the \\xe2\\x80\\x98tipping point\\xe2\\x80\\x99 where smart city\\nsolutions are sought after. This means that the bulk of projects have\\ninitially been geared to solving key pressing issues, such as urban\\nmobility. Focus on developing innovation, such as through the release of\\nopen data for example, has received less attention.\\nThe study found that cities in Asia and the Indian Subcontinent are able to\\nrapidly execute their vision, particularly smaller cities. This is due to strong\\nnational support for smart cities in the face of tremendous urban\\npopulation growth. These regions are often able to find a more cohesive\\nvision for the development of their smart cities on account of a more\\ntop-down approach to the market. Juniper anticipates that a similar ranking\\nin future would skew more in favour of these regions.\\n\\n9\\n\\nOn a macro level, the study found that North American and West\\nEuropean cities are typically more advanced in terms of transparency as\\nwell as their openness in adopting processes that rely on inter-city best\\npractices and learnings. This means that information regarding smart city\\nprojects and cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 overall vision is far more readily available; meanwhile,\\nthese cities actively seek expertise from a wide range of actors, including\\nthird party entities and citizens themselves. Cities in Far East & China on\\nthe other hand, are more opaque in terms of their approach. Additionally,\\nthese cities have to contend with a lower proportion of citizens who are\\nconnected and able to benefit from smart city services. This means that\\nthe impact of roll-outs is not yet as significant as in other regions; indeed,\\nfor many cities in the Indian Subcontinent as well as the Far East & China,\\nemphasis is placed first on connecting citizens with a view to rolling out\\nwider smart city solutions at a later point.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nA Smart City Future\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cImagine a world where all cities are smart and able to thrive as part of a cohesive effort\\nbetween municipalities, businesses and citizens.\\nMany cities are now becoming smarter, adopting strategies to address a growing need to\\nimprove their \\xe2\\x80\\x98liveability\\xe2\\x80\\x99.

Meanwhile, parking space availability can be\\nused to inform drivers where the nearest available space is, minimising the\\ntime spent \\xe2\\x80\\x98cruising\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for spaces.\\nJuniper has calculated the time benefit based on a long-term outlook of an\\naverage commute round-trip of 74 minutes. Meanwhile, ITS are expected\\nto have a 10% positive benefit over the baseline. In both instances, the\\nfigures used are the result of anticipated population rises leading to\\ngreater pressure on infrastructure.\\n\\nCity open data can be harnessed to enable both city agencies and third\\nparties to develop innovation around that data. In the case of mobility,\\ndaily commute times can be reduced by up to 15% by highlighting\\noptimum routes for any given time of day, while suggesting the most\\nefficient transport mode.\\n\\nCashless payments are likely to impact some 360 billion journeys per year.\\nOn average, passengers will save 25 seconds every time they make a\\npayment.\\n\\nInitiatives such as AVs, MaaS and policies that succeed in moving modal\\nshare away from public transport, will create safer roads. The net result will\\nbe increased life expectancy, translating to nearly 8 hours per year for\\ncitizens.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nCase Study: San Francisco\\n\\nMaaS, AVs are crucial to reducing\\nvehicle ownership & congestion\\nThe USA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98love affair\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with the automobile has,\\nin cities such as San Francisco, led to chronic\\ncongestion. According to TomTom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual\\ncongestion index, San Francisco drivers waste\\n150 hours every year in congestion.\\nThe city has recognised this as a key issue and\\ndeveloped a comprehensive strategy in an\\nattempt to address the situation. Indeed, in 2016\\nit received some $11 million in funding, some of\\nwhich has been earmarked to intelligently phase\\ntraffic lights to prioritise public transport. The\\nfollowing highlights 2 key elements of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfuture mobility strategy.\\nIntegrated & Shared Mobility\\nWith 540 vehicles per 1,000 capita, the city notes\\nthat too many citizens are using their own\\nvehicles to travel across the city. Meanwhile,\\non-demand rideshare companies have created\\n\\n12\\n\\nCase Study \\xe2\\x80\\x93 San Francisco\\nmuch-needed competition for traditional taxi\\nservices, but the number of vehicles on the road,\\nalongside uncertain regulation, have created a\\nseparate set of issues.\\nThe city has thus set out a vision for a\\ntechnology platform supporting an integrated\\nservice, allowing citizens to choose from a range\\nof modal options. The primary elements of this\\nvision are:\\nTransportation as a Platform: establishment of\\na city framework for an integrated service\\nacross multiple providers;\\nTransport as a Service: development of a\\nconsumer solution to handle pricing, routing,\\nbooking and payment through a single\\nplatform.\\nShared AVs (Autonomous Vehicles)\\nAVs deployed as shared, on-demand service\\nvehicles will reduce the need for car ownership,\\nwhere services are deployed as multi-occupancy\\nrides, with vehicle passengers determined by\\nsimilar origin, route or destination.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the ability to drive safely in close\\nproximity will maximise the road space and in\\nturn reduce congestion.\\nVehicles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 communication with city infrastructure\\nwill ensure that software analytics running in the\\nbackground can determine optimal traffic light\\nphasing according to real-time conditions.\\nExpected Outcomes\\nThe city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision is that every citizen will be able\\nto select their journey across the city,\\non-demand, within 2 minutes. Journey time\\nacross the city should take no longer than 20\\nminutes. This would shave a third off of the\\ncurrent average San Francisco one-way\\ncommute time.\\nOther benefits as a result of lower congestion,\\nlower transit overcrowding and deployment of\\nshared AVs include improved air quality, lower\\ntravel costs and reduced traffic fatalities.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nHealthcare\\n\\n13\\n\\nHealthcare: inefficient healthcare systems mean services are complex to navigate and can sometimes result in poor\\noutcomes for patients.\\nStudy Hypothesis: Smart cities will improve patient access and result in better quality healthcare delivery.\\n\\nImagine a world where smart cities give back:\\nAI (artificial intelligence) will be used as a key element in future chatbots\\nand services access, enabling them to be used as preliminary diagnosis\\ntools for triage, or to generate appointments. Alone, chatbots can save\\nan average of 15 minutes per contact over traditional mechanisms.\\nThe study found that digital health services can play a big role in\\ncreating efficiencies, with benefits felt at both the citizen level as well as\\non the caregiving side; these are indicated below.\\n\\nThe research found that in instances where telemedicine services had\\nbeen deployed, overall patient hospital re-admission rates were reduced\\nby between 20% and 40%. The net effect of a global roll-out would be to\\ndramatically reduce the number of instances where wait times for\\nhospital beds exceed 4 hours.\\n\\nThe average citizen visits the doctor 5 times a year; more when they are\\nelderly or suffer from a chronic condition. Apps that analyse data\\nreceived from \\xe2\\x80\\x98quantified self\\xe2\\x80\\x99 devices, as well as remote physician\\nappointments by video link, can serve to reduce, or even eliminate,\\nphysical visits to the physician.\\n\\nIndividuals suffering from chronic conditions will often have to visit their\\nphysician multiple times per year; even now, over one-third of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npopulation is in need of long-term healthcare management. In this case,\\nremote monitoring devices can help reduce the need for physical\\ndiagnoses, while helping to better manage long-term conditions.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nCase Study: London\\n\\nFocus on elderly care, digital services\\ndelivery and leveraging emerging\\nplatforms key to Seoul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision\\nSeoul is, along with other major cities in\\ndeveloped regions, faced with the challenge of\\nLjkjjkjkjkjkjkjkl; m\\nan ageing population, which in turn is beginning\\nto put pressure on healthcare services.\\nMeanwhile, citizen physical activity levels have\\nbeen steadily decreasing since 2005, which in\\nturn has led to increasing risk of health related\\nissues as a result of obesity.\\nU-Health\\nSeoul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan for healthcare delivery is formulated\\nunder the \\xe2\\x80\\x98U-Health\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Ubiquitous Health)\\nstrategy. Initially, this has involved transforming\\nthe manner by which citizens, in particular\\nelderly citizens, are able to access healthcare.\\nAs part of this project, healthcare monitoring\\ndevices were initially sent out to a select number\\nof citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 homes, allowing caregivers to\\nremotely monitor key indicators, such as blood\\npressure. More recently, this model has been\\n\\n14\\n\\nCase Study \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Seoul\\nexpanded; local community centres now act as\\nremote clinics where elderly patients are able to\\nuse these monitoring devices, thus saving time\\nand unnecessary one-to-one physician visits.\\nUnder the same strategy, future deployments will\\ninvolve distribution of sensors to detect when\\nelderly citizens are in distress, or have suffered a\\nfall, whereby caregivers can be dispatched to\\ntheir location quickly.\\nSharing Economy\\nAs part of Seoul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98sharing city\\xe2\\x80\\x99 initiative which\\nhas promoted sharing economy technologies\\nand services since 2013, the city has set out a\\nprogram aimed at reducing elderly isolation from\\nthe community. The Ministry of Health and\\nWelfare reported in 2015 that close to 1.4 million\\nelderly citizens were living alone in the city; as\\nsuch, Seoul has aimed to reduce this figure by\\nencouraging home-sharing platforms to match\\nelderly citizens with young room seekers.\\n\\nStrong Healthcare Delivery\\nDespite the current national legislative landscape\\nmeaning that emerging healthcare technologies,\\nsuch as telehealth, are in their infancy, Seoul\\nhas positioned itself to ensure that healthcare\\ndelivery is as strong as it can be under current\\nconditions. Hospital bed availability, for example,\\nis very high, while urban planning since 2010\\nhas been focused on increasing physical activity\\nlevels through the provision of urban green way\\nroutes as part of the Healthy Living\\nEnvironments project.\\nMeanwhile, the city has ensured that technology\\nwill both directly and indirectly influence citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nhealth in a positive manner. City-wide Wi-Fi is\\navailable free to citizens which, coupled with a\\nstrategy for digital delivery of public services, will\\nensure that healthcare services can be accessed\\nanywhere. Meanwhile, the strong focus on\\nelectric vehicle charging infrastructure, including\\na sub-surface charging project for electric public\\ntransport vehicles in motion, will ensure that air\\npollutants are lowered as electric vehicle take-up\\nincreases.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nPublic Safety\\n\\n15\\n\\nPublic Safety: high levels of crime can negatively impact citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 happiness, or worse, if those crimes are violent.\\nEmergency services often struggle to reach victims in clogged city streets.\\nStudy Hypothesis: Smart cities will reduce violent crime and reduce emergency service response delays.\\n\\nImagine a world where smart cities give back:\\n\\nJuniper estimates that improvements in public safety; in particular\\nemergency response, can have substantial time-benefits for citizens. In\\naddition to this, the study found that the intangible benefits of smart cities\\nwould result in 4 million citizens leading happier lives every year. This\\nwould, for example, be achieved via an assumed 10% reduction in violent\\ncrime, as well as a 15% improvement in emergency response times; with\\nboth benefits serving to reduce the impact of stressful life events. A\\nbreakdown of the benefits are outlined below.\\n\\nMachine learning can be leveraged to generate predictions around where\\ncrime is likely to occur on any given day. This allows law enforcement to\\ntarget patrols in such areas, helping reduce crime more efficiently. The\\nstudy estimated that such software could lead to the prevention of 3 million\\nviolent crimes. In addition to this, machine learning can be deployed as a\\n\\ntool for CCTV surveillance analysis; detection of unusual activity in\\nreal-time can serve to reduce response times to crime. Machine learning\\ncan also be used to predict where fires or flooding might happen.\\nMeanwhile, the study found that where cities integrated their emergency\\nservices with the municipal traffic control system, the prioritisation of\\nemergency services vehicles and re-routing of civilian traffic could reduce\\narrival times by nearly 50%.\\n\\nIn medical terms, the \\xe2\\x80\\x98golden hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99 refers to the period of time after a\\nlife-threatening incident where treatment is most likely to save lives. Note\\nthat this \\xe2\\x80\\x98hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is not always an hour, depending on the severity of the\\ncircumstances; nonetheless, in all instances, the side-effect of faster\\nemergency response times is an increase in average life expectancy. This\\neffect has a global impact, in the context of violent crime, road traffic\\nincidents and chronic conditions such as heart disease.\\nThe research found that in critical situations, every minute without CPR or\\ndefibrillation reduces survival chances by 10%; therefore, the study\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmodest 15% improvement in response times highlights that fact that every\\nminute counts.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nCase Study: Nice\\n\\nData, predictive modelling and\\ninter-agency co-ordination helps New\\nYork improve public safety standards\\nOnce known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98murder capital\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the USA,\\nNew York has made substantial inroads in\\naddressing improved public safety standards\\nover the past 20 years. In fact, the city now ranks\\nas the safest of all of the major cities in the\\ncountry.\\nData-driven Approaches\\nNew York was the pioneer of statistical policing,\\nbeginning with the deployment of CompStat in\\n1994. This programme was relatively simple in\\nnature (mapping and logging crimes according to\\ntime series and location data), but allowed the\\npolice force to identify key crime hot-spots and\\ndevise strategies aimed at increasing public\\nsafety in each area. CompStat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legacy has\\nsince formed the foundation for modern policing\\nacross the globe.\\n\\n16\\n\\nCase Study \\xe2\\x80\\x93 New York City\\nMore recently, the city conducted a 2 year trial of\\nHunchLab, a predictive crime software solution.\\nWhere previously the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98stop and frisk\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nprogramme served a statistically effective, albeit\\nhighly controversial, method of reducing crime\\nrates in the city, the new software uses data and\\nstatistical modelling, including historical crime\\ndata, terrain modelling as well as time and\\nweather information to correlate where crimes\\nhappen with specific types of locations.\\nThese types of approaches do not stop at law\\nenforcement. With capacity to inspect only\\none-third of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s buildings annually, the\\nNYC fire department required an innovative\\napproach to reducing building fire damage. Here,\\nit compiled a list of 60 factors influencing building\\nfire risks. These factors, alongside historical data\\nand predictive modelling, have allowed the\\ndepartment to target areas most likely to require\\nbuilding safety inspection.\\nCross-departmental Vision\\nNew York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smart city strategy applies a\\nmulti-pronged approach for improving public\\n\\nsafety. In this context, the city aims not only to\\nreduce the number of road traffic incidents and\\nviolent crime, but also the manner in which these\\nare treated. For instance, emergency response\\nteams are well-integrated, allowing disparate\\nagencies to function more efficiently, while a\\ndisaster response strategy has been established\\nto better co-ordinate emergency response with\\nthe public in the event of a major incident. This\\nlatter development is key, considering that the\\ncity has been subject to the second highest\\nnumber of terrorism-related events of the cities\\nevaluated in the study.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nProductivity\\n\\n17\\n\\nProductivity: high levels of inequality in cities often restrict opportunities to wealthier citizens. Additionally, the\\ncomplex labyrinth of city regulations and red tape present laborious, costly challenges for entrepreneurs.\\nStudy Hypothesis: Smart cities will democratise citizen opportunities and improve regulatory regulation.\\n\\nImagine a world where smart cities give back:\\n\\nJuniper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study found that numerous services in the average city are ripe\\nfor disruption in terms of how they are organised and delivered. This is\\nparticularly the case where data is used to create more efficicent\\nservices; these range from complex issues surrounding the\\nestablishment of businesses in the city, to simple services, such as retail\\npayments.\\n\\nCity departments have historically operated in silos from one another.\\nThe concept of ongoing shared information used as a means to create\\nefficiency has been rarely implemented until recently. The result of this\\nhas been that, for example, the complex rules and permits required to\\nstart a business can use up a substantial amount of time. Citizens of\\nRio de Janeiro, for example, must wait on average for 45 days before\\ntheir new business can begin operations. Meanwhile, cities still hold\\nmuch of their data using paper copies, or still rely on antiquated\\n\\nmechanisms to share information. Some UK NHS Trusts, for example,\\nmust print and fax their patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 electronic health records owing to a\\nfailure to establish interoperable systems.\\nThe study found that substantial time-savings could be achieved, if\\ninformation was stored using interoperable software systems and\\naggregated using APIs or similar mechanisms. It found, for example,\\nthat Rio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 45 days could be reduced to a single day if this kind of\\napproach were applied.\\n\\nThe study has also focused on cashless payments on transport systems.\\nHere, additional time-savings were considered in the retail environment\\nacross the city. Juniper found that, on average, citizens have the potential\\nto save 15 seconds per transaction using cashless mechanisms, with the\\nassumption that, under some circumstances, the transaction value of\\nitems purchased would not realise the full time saving benefits of a\\ncontactless payment.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\nCase Study: New York City\\n\\nDigital democratisation and open data\\nfoundation helps London increase\\ncitizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 productivity\\nLondon has long been considered a capital for\\ninnovation, with several schemes in place aimed\\nat improving citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 productivity.\\nOpen Data Pioneer\\nLondon was one of the first cities in the world to\\nrecognise the potential of open data, launching\\nthe London Data Store in 2010. This data\\nrepository, which includes information from\\nvarious public agencies, led to the creation of the\\nCitymapper app, allowing citizens to plan their\\njourney across the city according to real-time\\ntraffic and transport information. More recently,\\nCitymapper has analysed available data to\\nidentify public transport routes that are either\\ninefficient, or lacking in service availability. This\\nresulted in the launch of the Citymapper\\nsmartbus service, a pilot route offering citizens a\\nreal-time view of the buses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 position alongside\\n\\n18\\n\\nCase Study \\xe2\\x80\\x93 London\\nsoftware integration for advanced service\\nscheduling according to real-time conditions.\\nEncouraging Talent\\nMeanwhile, the city has positioned itself as a hub\\nfor fostering digital talent and innovative\\nservices. London is rated as one of the top cities\\nin terms of \\xe2\\x80\\x98ease of doing business\\xe2\\x80\\x99; ie, the red\\ntape to overcome and timespan required to\\nestablish and operate a new business.\\nAdditionally, initiatives such as Tech City UK\\nhave provided funding for emerging digital\\ncompanies; this, in combination with a high level\\nof conferences and smart city hackathons has\\nincreased the overall level of engagement\\nbetween citizens and business to address\\ncity-specific challenges.\\nConnecting Business & Citizens\\nRecognising that access to digital services is key\\nto driving productivity, the Super-connected\\nCities scheme was launched in 2012 in the UK.\\nThe scheme, of which London was a part,\\nencouraged SMEs to apply for vouchers to help\\npay for installation of high-speed broadband\\n\\naccess. This concept was later extended to\\ncitizens themselves, with London following on\\nfrom New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s successful Link NYC\\nprogramme in converting payphone boxes into\\ncity Wi-Fi hotspots. The LinkUK project aims to\\nconvert 1,000 payphone boxes, with the service\\nfunded by advertising displayed on kiosks\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nscreens.\\nDigital Skills from the Ground Up\\nLondon has recognised that the economy is\\nincreasingly driven by digital technology. As\\nsuch, the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Smart London plan declared that\\nextra funding would be channelled into the\\neducational system to increase uptake of\\ncomputer science courses. Additionally, the\\nGreater London Authority conducted an\\nassessment of the impact of digital exclusion\\n(lack of access to digital services) in 2015,\\nalongside a set of measures to reduce exclusion.\\nIn turn, this has resulted in schemes to increase\\ndigital literacy as well as reducing barriers for\\ngetting citizens online.\\n\\n\\x0cSMART CITIES \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WHAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN IT FOR CITIZENS?\\n\\n19\\n\\nStudy Appendix\\n\\nAppendix: Study Methodology\\n\\nMethodology: How did we get the numbers?\\n\\nData Collection\\nThe first stage of this study involved the assessment of cities across the globe, in terms of their vision, strategy and deployments.

data collection, scenarios were modelled across each index to\\nexamine potential citizen benefits. These benefits are examined in terms\\nof:\\nHistorical roll-outs smart initiatives (as per those indicated as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98time-benefit\\xe2\\x80\\x99 metrics) in the data;\\nProjected impacts of smart initiatives.\\nThe benefits, as measured in terms of their impact across the cities\\nanalysed for this study, are translated using weighted averages to a\\nper capita metric. The global city population is then used to make a\\nprojection for the overall potential of smart cities.\\n\\nAssumptions in the Model\\nThe projections are based upon smart city service take-up being at, or\\nclose to, 100%. This take-up is reduced where, for example, a service\\nmight only impact the adult population.\\nBarriers to roll-outs, in terms of scaling, financing and so on, are not\\naccounted for in this study.\\nWhere city-specific data was not available, regional or national data was\\nused, with assumptions related to the city in question used to calculate a\\ncity-specific datapoint.\\nAssumptions were made with regard to data such as annual intra-city\\ntrips, shopping excursions and annual trips to the physician; these data\\n\\n24\\n\\nwere not adjusted according to regional or national differences for the\\npurposes of making projections.\\n\\nGlobal Smart City Index\\nFollowing data collection:\\nRaw scores were first ranked according top-performing (20) to\\nlowest-performing city (1).\\nWeights were assigned to each ranked variable under the index to arrive\\nat a score.\\nThis methodology was also used to calculate a score in terms of the\\ncities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 overall smart city vision, using the \\xe2\\x80\\x98initial indicators\\xe2\\x80\\x99 data.\\nThe scores were added together to form the final score per index and\\noverall.\\n\\n\\x0c\""
